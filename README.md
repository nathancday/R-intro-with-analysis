# Spreadsheets to Rstats
### An introduction to R through analysis

General audience: People who perform analysis with spreadsheets, but have not been exposed to scripting languages.

Specific audience: The examples here are of assay analysis so anyone involved with bio-chemical analysis will be right at home. Specifically researchers that are interested in Rstats and reproducibile research will get the most out of this.

This material is designed as a half-day (4-hour) workshop, with slides and exercises.

The slides are [available here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q2Ij3xv5mhheB0WPhZ6tpPJKMrIzkduz_tVtwpg4Sws/edit?usp=sharing) and are broken into 4 sections:

* Computer languages and the basic building blocks of R
* Visualizations with ggplot2
* Manipulations with dplyr
* Statistical testing and capstone exercise

Excercises are avaialbe in [Rstudio Cloud here](https://rstudio.cloud/project/411105) and also here in this repo. The exercises are broken into four scripts, one for each section, and one directory with Excel files.

** Notes about the Rstudio Cloud instance **
* It is set to be available (i.e. public), but I have experienced problems sharing it, open an issue if you encounter the same.
* Once you get in, make sure you save it as copy for yourself. If you don't you risk losing all of you work ðŸ˜Ÿ
