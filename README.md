### An introduction to R through analysis

This material is designed as a 4-hour workshop, and is broken up into 4 sections (1-hour each) for maximum flexibility. Everything is based in the cloud, so no installations are required.

The sections:

* Computer languages and the basic building blocks of R
* Importing data from Excel and visualizing it with ggplot2
* Manipulating data with dplyr
* Statistical testing and capstone exercise

General audience: People who do analysis with spreadsheets, and want to learn how to do it with R. *No prior coding experience is expected.*

Specific audience: The examples here are of assay analysis so anyone involved with biochemical analysis will be right at home. Specifically researchers that are interested in Rstats and reproducibile research will get the most out of this.

Slides are available [on Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q2Ij3xv5mhheB0WPhZ6tpPJKMrIzkduz_tVtwpg4Sws/edit?usp=sharing) and also in this repo as `.pdf` and `.ppt` files.

Excercises are avaialbe in [Rstudio Cloud here](https://rstudio.cloud/project/411105) and also here in this repo. The exercises are broken into four scripts, one for each section. The is one directory `/data/` with Excel files.

** Notes about the Rstudio Cloud instance **
* It is set to be available (i.e. public), but I have had problems sharing it, open an issue if you encounter the same.
* Once you get in, make sure you save it as copy for yourself. If you don't you risk losing all of you work ðŸ˜Ÿ
